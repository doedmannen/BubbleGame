# BubbleGame
This is a simple JavaScript game written using p5.js.
The objective is to collect green bubbles and to avoid anything red.
The green bubbles makes the player grow in size, so on some levels
there are yellow bubbles that shrinks the player. Yellow bubbles only
exist for a short period of time.

Recognition:
This game is based on lessons from Daniel Shiffman (The Coding Train).
I have built this game on what he made in his lessons.

Thank you Dan for giving me a great intro to JavaScript and p5.js!
