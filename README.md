# BubbleGame
This is a simple JavaScript game written using p5.js.
The objective is to collect green bubbles and to avoid anything red.
The green bubbles makes the player grow in size, so on some levels
there are yellow bubbles that shrinks the player. Yellow bubbles only
exist for a short period of time.

This is my first project in JavaScript and my first time trying out GitHub.

Recognition:
This game is influenced on the bubble lessons on Daniel Shiffmans
youtube channel The Coding Train. I've based the game on code that he
wrote and added functions to make it into a game.

Thank you Dan for giving me a great intro to JavaScript and p5.js!
I love the coding train.




-- Needed to be done:
1. Smoothing of the game


-- Issues:

No known issues at the moment.


-- Suggestions:

1. Make red bubbles move toward the players location, if close... like zombies?
2. Up the spazm by increaing move() on every 5th level and resetting bubbles.
